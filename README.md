### üìò Project Guidelines

**CINETEL TELECOM** is a conceptual prototype of a wireless internet and telephony service provider built around alternative and experimental technologies such as **Backhaus networking**, **UHF Internet**, and **IPC connectivity**.

This repository presents the early-stage guidelines for version **1.0 Beta**, integrating several interconnected modules and systems, forming the basis of a decentralised and modular communication and data service framework.

- DSP-based software for evaluating relay installations using photo analysis and route planning for operational drones (**PLUTO DISK**)

#### üì° Wireless Hardware
- UHF radio-based internet access with wireless antenna and router prototype

#### üß† AI-Driven Development
- **AZ-Wally**: An AI research and development module for software synthesis, documentation, and intelligent factorisation of digital and embedded systems

#### üì∫ Streaming & Multimedia
- **ATLAS TV STREAMING**: IPTV and VOD modular service component

#### üß∞ Data Layer
- **Python Database X-AI ORM**: Intelligent object-relational mapping with machine learning enhancement

#### üíø Operating System (Future Release)
- **Atlas Mundi**: A FreeBSD-based custom operating system, focused on networking, multimedia, and embedded control

#### üîß Electronic Engineering (Embedded Systems)
- **Assembly-Electronic-PCB**: A platform and toolkit for engineering and developing electronic circuit boards with OS-assisted CAD and embedded software integration
